Version: Spring 2018\
EC200: Applied Econometrics

**EC200: Research Paper**\

One main product of the course is an original research paper you'll
produce that incorporates econometric data using the methods we've
learned in class. **You can work alone or in pairs.**

Learning objectives {#learning-objectives .unnumbered}
===================

-   Develop clear, answerable research questions and link them to
    economic theory.

-   Identify and apply appropriate econometric methods to answer
    research question, recognizing necessary assumptions and limitations

-   Conduct and interpret original data analysis using Stata

-   Strengthen written and oral communication skills

Topic selection {#topic-selection .unnumbered}
===============

Select a research question that is interesting to you and answerable
with data that you can obtain. Your question should accomplish the
following.

-   It must have clear relevance to economic theory

-   It must be answerable using data.

-   It may not be an exact replication of previous work. It may,
    however, be an extension.

-   It must use *cross-sectional* or *panel* data. There are lots of
    interesting time-series questions, but we will not cover these
    topics in EC200.

Research paper process {#research-paper-process .unnumbered}
======================

Research ideas {#research-ideas .unnumbered}
--------------

Prepare a set of 3 research ideas. An "idea" only needs to consist of
about 1-2 paragraphs, which should include a research question, a
proposed data set, and a rough plan of analysis. In class, we will form
teams and informally discuss your ideas. Your teammates will provide
feedback on which topics might be most promising, how you might refine
your research questions or empirical strategy approach, and challenges
you might want to think about in advance.

If you are developing your own research questions, at least one
questions should be from the suggested list of topics (this can be your
back-up plan).

After your idea discussion, you may decide to pair up with a classmate.
That's great!

Data preparation  {#data-preparation .unnumbered}
----------------

In research, sometimes questions drive the data we choose, and sometimes
the data we have drive the questions we ask. With only one semester to
build a paper, you will likely let the data take the lead. Your first
submission should include the following:

-   Research question: This should be a clear, specific, answerable
    question.

-   Summary statistics: To ensure your question is answerable, find an
    appropriate data set. Load it into Stata, and produce a table of
    summary statistics of your independent variable and some key
    dependent variables. This will likely be Table 1 in your research
    paper.

-   In your submission, include the Stata do-file that produces your
    summary statistics, and the accompanying log.

Research proposal  {#research-proposal .unnumbered}
-----------------

From the list of topics, choose and develop one research idea for your
proposal presentation. Write up a **four- to six-page** proposal (double
spaced, excluding tables) for your research paper. This proposal should
provide as much detail as possible to help your classmates assess your
plan and provide useful feedback.

Your research proposal should include the following components:

-   Clearly stated research question

-   Motivation - why is this important/interesting?

-   Link to related literature - what do we already know?

-   Data set

-   Empirical specification: You **must** include the empirical
    specification of the regression(s) you are estimating, along with a
    clear description of what each variable is.

-   Planned analysis: How will you interpret your results? What
    challenges/limitations will you face? This is a good place to
    discuss any omitted variable bias, other possible violations of our
    assumptions, etc.

A classmate will provide a peer review of your proposal, providing
feedback to help you turn your proposal into a final paper

Rough draft (optional)  {#rough-draft-optional .unnumbered}
----------------------

You may submit one rough draft to me for comments. This is optional, but
I **highly recommend** you do it, because the early deadline can help
you stay on track, and you'll have a chance to get an early sense of how
things are going.

Presentation {#presentation .unnumbered}
------------

You'll make a brief (5-10 minute) presentation of your paper in the
final week of class. I will provide specifics later.

Paper components  {#paper-components .unnumbered}
================

A number of excellent guides can help you put together an effective and
interesting research paper. One of my favorites is by Plamen Nikolov,
which is available on Blackboard. Chapter 19 of Wooldridge's textbook,
also on Blackboard, provides a nice overview as well.

In general, it should include the following components: abstract (fewer
than 250 words), introduction, background, methodology, results,
conclusion, references, figures, and tables.

Parameters {#parameters .unnumbered}
----------

-   All paper elements -- idea proposal, paper proposal, first draft,
    peer review forms, final research paper -- should be submitted
    electronically via Blackboard in Word format.

-   Format your tables in Excel or comparable software. Do not copy and
    paste Stata output.

-   Length requirements vary depending on the number of people in your
    group and are based on the the text of your paper only. A one-person
    project should be 2500-3500 words. A two-person project should be
    3500-4500 words. These guidelines **exclude** the title page,
    abstract, references, figures, and tables.

-   No appendices. If it's important, include it in the paper. If it's
    not, then don't include it.

-   Formatting: 12 pt font, 1\" margins, double spacing, Times New
    Roman. No spaces between paragraphs. Include page numbers.

-   Embed your figure/tables or include them at the end of the paper.
    These do not count towards your length.

-   You must also submit a Stata do-file that replicates your analysis
    and a log-file that shows your results. These do not count toward
    your page limit, and they should be submitted as separate files.

Deadlines {#deadlines .unnumbered}
=========

See course calendar for deadlines. Submit materials by **11:59pm** on
the deadline. Submit all assignments via Blackboard. Late assignments
will be penalized 10% per day, and they may not receive detailed
feedback. If something awful happens (medical emergency, computer crash,
etc.) that affects your ability to meet a deadline, please let me know
ASAP so we can make arrangements.

Grading {#grading .unnumbered}
=======

I will provide formal or informal grading rubrics for each component, so
you have a clear idea of how you'll be graded.

FAQ {#faq .unnumbered}
===

-   *How does my group size affect grading?* The grading rubric is the
    same regardless of your group sizes. However, I expect that in a
    larger group, your analysis will go deeper, your review of the
    literature will be more comprehensive, you'll have additional
    robustness or placebo tests, etc. See the page requirements for a
    guide. If you have questions, feel free to talk with me in more
    detail.

-   *Can I turn in a paper with 10 pages of text and 2 tables, or 10
    pages of tables and 5 pages of text?* Sure! The right balance
    between written explanation and figures/tables will depend on your
    topic, but 3-5 figures and tables will usually be about right. What
    matters most is that your paper clearly addresses your research
    question.

-   *How should I format my citations and bibliography?* Consistently.
    APA, Chicago, or MLA

-   *How much data analysis do I need to do?* You should incorporate
    data analysis to answer your research question or test your
    hypotheses. You may also use data to provide some descriptive
    statistics, however that alone would not be sufficient. Exactly how
    much analysis is involved will depend on the question you pose and
    your approach to answering it.

Recommended data sources {#recommended-data-sources .unnumbered}
========================

See p627 of Wooldridge (end of Chapter 19, available on Blackboard) for
links and lists of suggested data sets. Additional suggestions:

-   Data from the Minnesota Population Center (MPC)
    (<https://www.ipums.org/>) has put together well-documented, free
    microdata datasets available for the public. You need to fill out a
    brief form and wait up to 24 hours to get access

    -   IPUMS - USA: US Census data (1950-present, decennial)

    -   IPUMS - CPS: Current Population Survey (1962-present, annual
        (sometimes monthly)) - data on wages, work, and other special
        topics

    -   IPUMS - International: International Census data from nearly 80
        countries

    -   ATUS: American Time Use Survey (2003-present, annual)

    -   IDHS: Integrated Demographic and Health Series (18 countries,
        1980s-present)

    -   IHIS: Integrated Health Interview Series (US, annual,
        1960s-present)

    -   NAPP: North Atlantic Population Project (complete count Census
        data from 1800s, select countries)

-   ICPSR (<http://icpsr.umich.edu>): Source of wide range of data sets,
    some very obscure! Well documented. UVM is a member institution of
    ICPSR, so you should have full access to this resource.

-   General Social Survey (GSS, <http://www.gss.norc.org/>): Annual
    survey of US residents' attitudes towards a variety of social
    issues, plus demographic characteristics. You can do state-level
    comparisons with this data.

-   Some academic journals require published articles to include data
    and replication files. For example, *Journal of Applied
    Econometrics*, *Journal of Business and Economic Statistics*, and
    *American Economic Journal-Applied Economics*.

-   Collect your own! This option makes sense if the question is suited
    to getting primary data, and if it can be collected in a timely
    fashion.

Suggested topics  {#suggested-topics .unnumbered}
================

The following suggested topics are taken from Wooldridge. These can be
used as a starting point for your own idea generation. You can use these
questions as is, you can focus on a specific aspect of a question, or
you can add an additional subgroup or covariate to extend the analysis.
If you want to access the referenced data sets, just let me know.

1.  What factors might explain racial/ethnic and gender differences in
    employment and wages? For example, Holzer (1991) reviewed the
    evidence on the "spatial mismatch hypothesis" to explain differences
    in employment rates between blacks and whites. Korenman and
    Neumark (1992) examined the effects of childbearing on women's
    wages, while Hersch and Stratton (1997) looked at the effects of
    household responsibilities on men's and women's wages. Push harder
    than just identifying whether gender or racial/ethnic wage gaps
    exist (they do!).

2.  Do your own "audit" study to test for discrimination in hiring (by
    race, gender, some other dimension). Have pairs of equally qualified
    friends, say, one male and one female, apply for local job openings
    in local bars or restaurants. You can provide them with phony
    resumes that give each the same experience and background, where the
    only difference is gender (or race, or something else). Then, track
    who gets the interviews (and/or job offers). Neumark (1996)
    described one such study conducted in Philadelphia. A variant would
    be to test whether general physical attractiveness or a specific
    characteristic, such as being obese or having visible tattoos or
    body piercings, plays a role in hiring decisions. You would want to
    use the same gender in the matched pairs, and it may not be easy to
    get volunteers for such a study.

3.  Following Hammermesh and Parker (2005), try to establish a link
    between characteristics of college instructors (appearance, gender,
    nativity, age, etc) and student evaluations. Appearance measures can
    be obtained from a survey on campus. Crude data can be obtained from
    websites that allow students to rank their professors and provide
    information about their appearance. Ideally, though, any subjective
    evaluations of instructor characteristics would be not be done by
    current or former students, as those may be influenced by grade
    received.

4.  Obtain monthly or quarterly data on teenage employment rates, the
    minimum wage, and factors that affect teen employment to estimate
    the effects of the minimum wage on teen employment. Solon (1985)
    used quarterly U.S. data, while Castillo-Freeman and Freeman (1992)
    used annual data on Puerto Rico. It might be informative to analyze
    time series data on a low-wage state in the United States--where
    changes in the minimum wage are likely to have the largest effect.

5.  Do parental consent laws increase the teenage birthrate? You can use
    state level data for this: either a time series for a given state
    or, even better, a panel data set of states. Do the same laws reduce
    abortion rates among teenager? The *Statistical Abstract of the
    United States* contains all kinds of state-level data. Levine,
    Trainor, and Zimmerman (1996) studied the effects of abortion
    funding restrictions on similar outcomes. Other factors, such as
    access to abortions, may affect teen birth an abortion rate.

    There is also recent interest in the effects of "abstinence only"
    sex education curricula. one can again use state-level panel data,
    or maybe even panel data at the school district level, to determine
    the effects of abstinence-only approaches to sex education on
    various outcomes, including rates of sexually transmitted diseases
    and teen birth rates.

6.  Do change in traffic laws affect traffic fatalities? McCarthy (1994)
    contains an analysis of monthly time series data for the state of
    California. A set of dummy variables can be used to indicate the
    months in which certain laws were in effect. The file TRAFFIC2
    contains the data used by McCarthy. An alternative is to obtain a
    panel data set on states in the United States, where you can exploit
    variation in laws across states, as well as across time.
    Freeman (2007) is a good example of a state-level analysis, using 25
    years of data that straddle changes in various state drunk driving,
    seat belt, and speed limit laws.

7.  Use panel data to study the effects of various economic policies on
    regional economic growth. Studying the effects of taxes and spending
    is natural, but other policies may be of interest. For example,
    Craig, Jackson, and Thomson (2007) study the effects of Small
    Business Association Loan Guarantee programs on per capita income
    growth.

8.  Do differences in tax codes across states affect the amount of
    foreign direct investment? Hines (1996) studied the effects of state
    corporate taxes, along with the ability to apply foreign tax
    credits, on investment from outside the United States
