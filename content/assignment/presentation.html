<p>Let’s share what we’ve been working on!</p>
<p>We have the following goals:
- To articulate your research design, methods, and results
- To learn about what your classmates have been working on
- To gain insights about ways to improve your paper and research design based on direct feedback and watching your classmates’ presentations</p>
<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>On your assigned day, you’ll deliver a 8-minute presentation.</li>
<li>One presentation per paper - if you are working with a partner, it should be one set of slides, with both members contributing</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example: <a href="../materials/example-f20.pptx">Example Presentation!</a></p>
