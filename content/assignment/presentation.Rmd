Let's share what we've been working on! 

We have the following goals: 
 - To articulate your research design, methods, and results 
 - To learn about what your classmates have been working on 
 - To gain insights about ways to improve your paper and research design based on direct feedback and watching your classmates' presentations 

## Overview 
 - On your assigned day, you'll deliver a 8-minute presentation. 
 - One presentation per paper - if you are working with a partner, it should be one set of slides, with both members contributing
 
Here is an example: [Example Presentation!](../materials/example-f20.pptx)
