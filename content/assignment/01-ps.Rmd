1.  Consider the above random variable, $X$, with its associated
    probability distribution:

    a.  Draw the probability distribution function and the cumulative
        distribution function.

    b.  What is the expected value of X? That is, what is $E[X]$?

    c.  What is the variance of X?

2.  Stock and Watson 2.6, 2.10, 2.18, 3.16

3.  For a randomly selected county in the United States, let $X$
    represent the proportion of adults over age 65 who are employed (the
    elderly employment rate). Then, $X$ is restricted to a value between
    zero and one. Suppose that the cumulative distribution function for
    $X$ is given by $F(x) = 3x^2 - 2x^3$ for $0 \leq x \leq 1$.

    a.  What is the probability that the elderly employment rate is at
        least 0.5 (50%)?

    b.  What is the probability that the elderly employment rate is
        between 0.4 (40%) and 0.6 (60%)?
