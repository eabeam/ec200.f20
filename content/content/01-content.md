Welcome to Week 1! Our goal this week is to (1) help us sort out our varying technologies and workflows and (2) review some statistics! Basically, this is week 1 of a two-week mini-bootcamp to get us ready for the glorious world of regressions!

I'll ask you to self sort: 
- **I took EC170/STAT141 recently and remember some stuff:** Read through SW, and dig deeper into anything that doesn't look familiar. Watch the class videos. Use the Khan Academy to clarify anything you feel a bit fuzzy on. Make sure you can do the practice problems. 
- **Everyone else** Start by reviewing the Khan Academy concepts. Work through *all* their practice problems. Then head into our EC200 practice problems.
