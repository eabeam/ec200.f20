# Problem sets {#problem-sets .unnumbered}

You'll be assigned weekly problem sets during the course. The
assignments will include theoretical, applied, and written problems, and
many will be Stata-based. Some may require you to read academic papers
and/or obtain data. Some may require you to complete the lab from a
previous week.

Your problem sets are graded on completion. I will check to make
sure you reasonably attempted the problems, and that you have submitted
all the appropriate documentation. 30\% is based on accuracy.


You should submit your problem 
You can write up or type your problem sets.



# Labs {#labs .unnumbered}


We will have labs about once a week, these are noted in the class
calendar. Labs will give you a chance to apply your econometrics
knowledge and build your Stata skills. I strongly encourage you to work
with others, but you need to submit your completed log-file (and any
other necessary documents) to Blackboard at the end of class.

Labs will be graded based on completion and effort, and I will
drop your lowest lab grade.


# Deadlines and extensions {#deadlines-and-extensions .unnumbered}

-   All deadlines are at 2:20pm.

-   As a general rule, problem sets are due on Fridays at 2:20pm. Video
    quizzes and final labs are due on Mondays at 2:20pm.

-   Please submit all assignments through Blackboard. If you encounter
    technical issues, e-mail is a good last resort.

-   I have an "**extensions for all**" policy for all assignments. If
    you need an extension, you should request it by e-mail **before**
    the deadline and provide (a) your work so far (if applicable)
    and (b) a proposed new deadline. Some assignments build on previous
    ones, so be careful when requesting that you don't put yourself in a
    tricky position. I don't need to know why you need the extension.
