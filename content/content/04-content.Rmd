## Overview

Welcome to Week 4! We are proceeding boldly into the world of **linear regression.** We're starting by looking into the *linear* relationship between two variables. 


![Not this](cheese-bedsheets.png)


What we *won't* be doing is controlling for other factors, nor conducting statistical inference. We won't be looking at non-linear relationships yet either! Bah. 

Rather, we're going to dive deep into what it means to look at how we can find a good estimate - nay, the best estimate! - of the relatonship between some $X$ and some $Y$.


This is where *Stock and Watson* really start to shine. I highly recommend basking in their expertise and conversational style. 

## Reading Guide

**Chapter 4: Linear Regression with One Regressor**

**SW 4.1** - The Linear Regression Model 

This section is packed w/ good intuition and **bolded** vocabulary. Make sure you know it! 

**SW 4.2** - Estimating the Coefficient of the Linear Regression Model? 

You should be able to estimate linear regression coefficients *by hand* :yawn:. 

**SW 4.3** Measures of Fit

Know how to use and interpret $R^2$, $ESS$, $TSS$, $SSR$ and $SER$. You will also need to know how to find these from raw Stata output as well. 

**SW 4.4** Least Squares Assumptions 

Known and understand the three least squares assumptions 

**SW 4.5**  Sampling Distribution of the OLS

Discuss unbiasedness of estimators and effects of larger vs. smaller sample sizes on standard errors. We won't calculate standard errors by hand.
